# FastEye – Accelerated Incident Resolution with AI-Powered Log Analysis

Cloud deployments are growing at breakneck speed. With complex system architectures designed to support varied technology deployments and diverse customer needs, the **volume and diversity of operational data** are expanding exponentially.  

Azure Fleet has grown from **5 million units** to over **30 million**, with projections pointing toward **100 million systems** in the next five years.  

This scale introduces a critical challenge: **diagnosing and identifying failure root causes quickly and accurately** across a vast and heterogeneous infrastructure.

## Challenges in Root Cause Analysis

Root cause analysis of incidents requires consideration of a broad spectrum of contributing factors:

- Customer deployment challenges  
- Configuration discrepancies  
- Firmware irregularities  
- Hardware malfunctions  

The diagnostic process is further complicated by:

- Distributed development environments  
- Fragmented documentation  
- Inconsistent access to historical failure data  

Moreover, the rapid expansion of system fleets does not inherently equate to the availability of adequately skilled personnel to manage and resolve emerging issues.
